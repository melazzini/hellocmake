# hellocmake

this is an example of a gtk+3 application that is intended to be used with an SDK created by yocto, and of course it also can be used on the host platform

this example also contains a recipe file that we can use as a reference when working with yocto

I have tested this with yocto-kirkstone and the core-image-sato base distro
